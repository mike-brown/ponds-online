    <h2>Applying the Maths!</h2>
    <h3>How does the model work?</h3>
    <p><span class="italic">Computational Fluid Dynamics</span> (CFD) employs the use of mathematical models to simulate the flow of fluids. While it is possible to resolve most scenarios using <span class="italic">Direct Numerical Simulation</span> (DNS), in which the entire range of turbulence scales must be resolved, this is often computationally complex and often impractical for large-scale models. Instead, our simulation has been designed to solve the Navier-Stokes equations within a finite volume; in which several assumptions have been made:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Conservation of Mass:</span> in an isolated system such as our pond simulato, mass may not be spontaneously created or destroyed. If a loss or gain of mass occurs there must be an appropriate process to explain it; since mass cannot simply 'fall' out of the simulation.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Conservation of Energy:</span> the change in energy of any particle must be equal to any work done or change in temperature; as energy may not be spontaneously created or destroyed. This is in essence the first law of thermodynamics.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Newton's Second Law:</span> this states that any change in momentum must equal the sum of the forces acting upon it.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Continuum:</span> the fluid being modelled is considered to be a Continuum. This is a formal way of saying that the scale at which the model is operating is large enough for any effects from the molecular structure and motion are irrelevant. Looking from one point to the next we should see no difference in characteristics. This means that a point of fluid is the smallest volume of the fluid where it can still be considered a continuum and the macroscopic properties still provide an adequate description.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Macroscopic Description:</span> the variables used to fully describe the motion of the fluid: such as pressure, velocity, density, and temperature; are all macroscopic. This means that they are averages over the microscopic variables which each molecule has. We assume that this is a complete description which continues on from our assumption of it being a continuum.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Two Dimensional:</span> in this example the model has only been applied in two dimensions. In essence it has been treated as a one meter slice of an infinity deep body of water. In reality this means additional contributions from vertical effects have been neglected but in pond structures these tend t be small due to the shallow depth.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Completely Isolated:</span> the fluid is also assumed to be completely isolated from its surroundings and so no change in temperature or work due to external forces (such as wind or wildlife) are included. Again this will decrease the accuracy of the results compared to real world data as temperature and external conditions can have very significant effects.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Vegetative Drag:</span> in this model the effect due to vegetation is accounted by the inclusion of an additional drag force to oppose the motion of the fluid. This drag force depends upon several experimentally found results and so may not be perfectly representative. Other schemes for vegetation do exist.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Steady State:</span> this model is a steady state solution which assumes no changes with respect to time occur to the flow field and that it has stabilized to some result after sufficient time has elapsed since flow began.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Incompressible Fluid:</span> in this simulation the fluid, namely liquid water, is assumed to be incompressible and so has a constant density at all points.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The finite volume method used here is based upon dividing the whole fluid into smaller volumes: sufficiently small enough to allow the accurate modelling of the flow field. In commercial software a mesh algorithm is used to generate a custom mesh of smaller volumes to improve accuracy. This will result in areas of probable complexity such as edges being divided into smaller volumes then the center of the fluid as the central flow field should be fairly constant. This approach in the interest of reducing processing time has instead simply divided the total volume into a grid of squares, each with the same lengths.</p>

    <p>In order to prevent the ''checker boarding'' of values a staggered grid has been used. This means that the grid of pressures, x velocities and y velocities are not the same size. For each pressure cell or point there is a velocity on each wall, two x velocities and two y velocities. This means that the x velocity grid has one more column than the pressure grid and the y velocity grid has one more row. This means that for a pressure cell with index (i,j) the x velocity (i,j) is the velocity on the wall to the west of it and (i+1,j) is the velocity on the wall to the east of the pressure. The same holds for y velocities with (i,j) in the y velocity grid to be the wall above or north of the pressure point and (i,j+1) to be the velocity of the wall below or south of the pressure cell. This arrangement may seem odd at first look but makes sense when it is remembered that computer graphics begin counting in the top left corner. By seeming to count backwards in the y direction we ensure the resulting graphics isn't up-down.</p>

    <p>The first step begins with two of the base assumptions, incompressibility and the conservation of mass. The conservation of mass can be written as the rate of change of mass for an element being equal to the net rate of flow of mass for that element. Mathematically this can be written like this;</p>

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \rho \bigtriangledown \circ \mathbf{u} = 0
    \end{equation*}
    \end{document}

    <p>In the above expression and all later equations u and v represent the x and y velocities respectively and where a bold u represents the total vector of velocity (u,v). The left hand side can be simplified using the assumption of the incompressibility of the fluid which states that density is constant, this gives us this;</p>

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = 0
    \end{equation*}
    \end{document}

    <p>Substituting this back into the conservation of mass the following result is found;</p>

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{equation*}
    \rho \bigtriangledown \circ \mathbf{u} = 0
    \end{equation*}
    \end{document}

    <p>This result will be very useful in this next derivation using the Navier-Stokes equations. The Navier-Stokes equations relate the change in velocity to a change in pressure plus effects from viscus stress and any other source or sink terms, they can be written like this;</p>

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{equation*}
    \rho \frac{D u}{D t} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \bigtriangledown \circ \mu \bigtriangledown u + S

    \rho \frac{D v}{D t} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \bigtriangledown \circ \mu \bigtriangledown v + S
    \end{equation*}
    \end{document}


    <p>In the formula above the S term contains the momentum sink and source terms and includes things such as gravity or magnetic interaction if applicatable. Here the use of D in the place of the normal or partial deltas signifiies total change of the variable over time and so can be expanded into this.</p>

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{equation*}
    \rho \frac{D u}{D t} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \bigtriangledown \circ \rho u \mathbf{u}
    \end{equation*}
    \end{document}

    <p>This shows the total change in a given moment of time to be the sum of the change of that variable with time and the change of the variable wth regards to space. Using the assumption of steady state the derivative with respect to time can be set to 0 and then using the following vector identity
       identity the Navier-Stokes equations can be simplified.</p>

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{equation*}
    \bigtriangledown \circ \rho u \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \circ \bigtriangledown \rho u + \rho u \bigtriangledown \circ \mathbf{u}
    \end{equation*}
    \end{document}

    <p> This gives the following result for the now simplified steady state Navier-Stokes equatons for an incompressible fluid. </p>
    <p>. **show the simplified equations here (ie the ones we used)** </p>
    <p>Next these equations were discretized so they could be applied to our staggered grid structure. The base of the algorithm used here is the SIMPLE algorithm, where a ''guessed'' pressure field is used to estimate a velocity field. This estiemated velocity field is then used to great a pressure correction field and from these two arrays a new, corrected array is created for velocity and pressure. The final step is to test the new arrays against the old and check for convergence, if none is found then the new fields become the old and the process is repeated. The discrete equation for u momentum can be written lke this after some work.</p>
    <p> **show discrete u momemtum equation** </p>
    <p>This equation calculates the estimated velocities from the old pressure field, the old velocity field and viscosity. The v momentum equation ia in the same form.</p>
    <p>**v discrete momentum equation**</p>
    <p>The derivation of how the discreteness was achieved are not given here but it was done by converting the differencuations into differences between adjacent cells over the distance between them which is the volume side length, after some rearrangment you arrive at the given formula. Both of these equations include ''a'' terms, these are co-effiecients that in essentence create a weighted average. They are calculated using a differencing mathode. In this work the TVD scheme was used to calculate the a values. For each cell five values were calculated. a central one of the cell in question and then the north, south, east and west values. These determin what the contribution from the velocities to the west, east, north and south are to the one in question. The coefficent terms are calculated using interface diifusion terms and mass flux terms as shown here.</p>
    <p> **show all the TVD stuff here**</p>
    <p>In the discrete equations the first term on the left side is a sum of the four surrounding neighbours. The next term is the change in velociity from pressure differenece across the velocity. The last term is the contribution from our sources from before, in this model the only addtion to this viscosity and the drag force if vegetation is present in the given location.</p>
    <p>This now means that as well as having u and v velocity arrays there are now estimated u and v arrays, called temp u and temp v in the actual code. These are now used to calculate a pressure coreection which takes the following form;</p>
    <p> **show pressure coreection here**</p>
    <p>The first term on the left is agian a weighted sum of it's neighbours, in this case it's neighbours in the previous step pressure chnages. The next term is the divergence of the estimated velocities. The coefficents here are calculated from the a coefficients for the veolcities like so;</p>
    <p>**show coefficients**</p>
    <p>Now using the velocity estimates and this array of pressure corrections new pressures and velocities can be generated using the following equations;</p>
    <p>**show the corection equations for new stuff**</p>
    <p>Now a convergence check is carried out where the old velocity arrays are taken off the new velocity arrays for both u and v, an average difference is then calculated and this is compared to a hard coded value where if the average difference is greater than the limit the process is repeated with the new arrays taking the place of the intial old arrays including the pressure correction. If the average difference is below the convergence limit then the simulation ends nd the final velocity flow field is displayed. This in theory is a complete method for calculating the steady state flow field for a given fluid however this will not always succeed. In order to improve stability and reliability under-relaxation factors have been included. These factors limit the chnage per cycle and so help prevent the program becoming trapped in ant local minimum as it steps toward convergence. These alter the equations slightly giving these new forms;</p>
    <p>**show the adjusted equations with the under-relaxation factors**</p>
