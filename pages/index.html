    <h2>Welcome to Ponds Online!</h2>
    <h3>What is Ponds Online?</h3>


    <p>Ponds Online is an online fluid simulator project for designing ponds and wetlands; which has been created as part of a SURE Network Project at the University of Sheffield. While we have strived to create a versatile simulator, our main focus is stormwater runoff treatment ponds; which play an import role in the treatment and redistribution of water within urban environments.</p>

    <p>Storm water is the runoff from rainfall events that build up on impermeable surfaces found all across an urban environment including roofs, pavements and highways. These ponds allow any sediment gathered to settle out and they also support the breakdown by local organisms of any smaller soluble nutrients or chemicals contained. Using these methods, stormwater can be effectively and efficiently treated within the pond system; after which the now-clean water can be redistributed back into the natural water table without harming the environment.</p>

    <p>Our simulation is a Lamar flow simulation based upon the discrete volume method including a staggered grid and under-relaxation factors. At its core it is built upon the Navier-Stokes equations including viscosity, written out in their discretized form. It does not currently contain any turbulent flow modelling and so can only give a general overview of the flow field for a given pond design. Even though our focus are storm water ponds the simulator will of course work on any pond for whatever purpose you envisage.</p>

    <h3>Why did we do this?</h3>
    <p>Currently, softwares capable of performing these kinds of simulations are expensive: typically costing between &pound;10,000 and &pound;50,000 for a licence. We wanted to provide both professionals and enthusiasts alike with the opportunity to experiment with computational fluid dynamics, without the costs or complexity associated with most commercial softwares.
