    <h2>Welcome to Ponds Online!</h2>
    <p>Hello and welcome to Ponds Online, this website contains information and a free to use flow simulator to help design efficient ponds. Our focus at Ponds Online are storm water-runoff treatment ponds which play an import role in urban environments.</p>

    <p>Storm water is the runoff from rainfall events that build up on impermeable surfaces found all across an urban environment including roofs, pavements and highways. These ponds allow any gathered sediment to settle out and break down any smaller soluble nutrients or chemicals contained and so provide treatment for storm water runoff. Once treated the now clean water can join the natural water table without causing any damage.</p>

    <p>Storm water is the runoff from rainfall events that build up on impermeable surfaces found all across an urban environment including roofs, pavements and highways. These ponds allow any sediment gathered to settle out and they also support the breakdown by local organisms of any smaller soluble nutrients or chemicals contained. Using these methods storm water is treated while inside the pond. Once treated the now clean water can join the natural water table without causing any damage.</p>
    <p>Our simulation is a Lamar flow simulation based upon the discrete volume method including a staggered grid and under-relaxation factors. At its core it is built upon the Navier-Stokes equations including viscosity, written out in their discretized form. It does not currently contain any turbulent flow modelling and so can only give a general overview of the flow field for a given pond design. Even though our focus are storm water ponds the simulator will of course work on any pond for whatever purpose you envisage.</p>
