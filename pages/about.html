    <h2>All about Ponds!</h2>
    <h3>What are ponds?</h3>

    <p>Ponds and wetlands are bodies with a permanent pool of water and are generally are not too large although their size depends a lot on the available space and function. They can be found in many areas including urban environments and they can host a wide range of life from microbes to plants.</p>

    <p>These are vitally important due to the amount of surfaces in a city or town that water cannot pass through like it would with soil. Normally during a rain storm water falls onto the ground and the bulk soaks in and joins the local water table, however since the creation of towns, cities and the urban environment this cannot always happen. In an urban setting rain falls onto pavements and roofs, onto tarmac and stone. Even the greenest city is still mostly made of waterproof materials, after all no one wants rain soaking through their house during a storm. With nowhere to go this water would build up causing widespread flooding during every storm and so rain water is collected and removed using sewers, but what do you do with this water now?</p>

    <p>This is where storm water-runoff ponds come in. The runoff from rain storms is polluted and full of dirt and sediment collected from the surfaces it has landed on and the pipes its been collected with, it cannot just go straight into the local water table or the nearest river without causing widespread environmental and ecological damage. To treat this water it enters a system containing a storm water pond where any collected sediment can settle out and any pollutants, nutrients or small chemicals can adhere and be broken down by the local ecology in the pond.</p>

    <p>These storm water ponds provide attenuation and treatment of surface water runoff but can also increase biodiversity and bring aesthetic benefits to an area. The difference between a pond and a wetlands is that wetlands are bodies of water with a significantly higher surface area covered with plants and vegetation. They also tend have bigger variations in depth and can contain shallow islands.</p>

    <p>The introduction of vegetation can increase the efficiency of these ponds. It can increase retention time by the increase in drag and so ensure that water spends sufficient time being treated within the pond before it leaves for the next stage or to enter the local water system. The vegetation as well as providing additional surfaces for pollutants to adhere to also supports the local microscopic ecology.</p>

    <p>How well a pond is at treating storm water runoff depends upon how water flows through it, how long water remains in the pond and how much of the volume is actually used. these criteria depend on many characteristics including the shape and placement of vegetation.</p>

    <h3>What makes a good pond?</h3>

    <p>Ponds are in general structured in the same basic way. The core of the pond is the permanent volume of water. Above this is the attenuation storage volume, this is the area of the pond that fills with water during a storm and it is here that treatment occurs in a storm water pond.

    <p>The attenuation storage volume is the temporary storage volume above the permanent pool that fills as water levels rise during rainfall events. This provides the required flow attenuation.</p>

    <p>Around the edge of the pool there will be an aquatic bench. This is an area of shallow water which supports wetland planting. It acts as a biological filter and provides ecology, amenity and safety benefits.</p>

    <p>There may be other islands of shallow areas in the pond to support additional vegetation. A concern to consider with wetlands is that the extent of water loss due to evaporation is taken. There should always be sufficient water to sustain the wetland vegetation throughout the year.</p>

    <p>Before storm water runoff enters the pond it should always be pre-treated. Coarse sediments and surface oils should be removed upstream. One option for this is a forebay. This is a smaller pool either located before the main pond or integrated at the beginning with some barrier separating it from the main pond. Here sediment will build up in one location making maintenance easier by confining the bulk of the work to this one area.</p>

    <p>The main treatment zone is the permanent volume which helps prevent resuspension of fine sediments. Ideally large ponds, such as wetlands should be divided into smaller pools. These pools are independent of one another and so water quality and quantity volume storage become independent too. This increases attenuation, creates longer pollutant removal pathways and so improves the removal of pollutants. This also makes an easier maintenance regime and more varied ecology.</p>

    <p>The actual design of the pond can vary a lot depending on its location, the surrounding environment and its purpose. The embankments can be designed to simulate a natural feature with grassy sloping sides or can compliment the dense urban surroundings.</p>

    <p>Safety should always be a consideration, especially if the pond is going to be in an area with large public access and so it should also contain a safe exceedance route and maintenance access to all areas of the pond. The addition of a flat safety bench around the perimeter of the pond provides suitable distance before open water and so discourages direct access and allows surveillance of the pond and rescue if required. This also provides a maintenance route.</p>
