    <h2>Ponds and SuDS.</h2>
    <h3>What are ponds?</h3>

    <p>In this section, the term <span class="italic">pond</span> is used to describe a feature designed to process <span class="italic">stormwater runoff</span>: rainfall that flows over the ground surface. Although distinctly smaller than lakes, the exact shape and size of ponds can vary; depending on the available space and function. In urban environments, some ponds may be incorporated into the local parks, or serve as a decorative feature for community spaces. In addition, most ponds provide a permanent pool of water (in contrast to <span class="italic">swales</span>, which serve a similar purpose) which can support a variety of floral and microbial life.</p>

    <p>Typically, these ponds are designed to temporarily store surface water, while also facilitating the settlement of suspended solids and removal of pollutants using plants and other biological systems. In most cases, such ponds will comprise one or more of the following features:</p>

    </figure>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Sediment Forebay:</span> in the event of residual sediment risks (i.e. particle settlement), the pond may be split such that sediment build-up is localised to a small area of the pond. This allows the sediment to be monitored more effectively, while also offering easier access for excavators.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Permanent Pool:</span> in most cases, a permanent volume of water will remain throughout the year; which acts as the main treatment zone for finer sediments.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Attenuation Storage:</span> in the event of rainfall, the pond may be supplied with a temporary storage volume to adequately store and attenuate (distribute) the excess water.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Aquatic Bench:</span> in shallow areas of a pond, wetland plants may be provided to act as a biological filter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What are SuDS?</h3>

    <p>The use of impermeable (fluid-obstructing) materials in urban environments, such as those used to construct roads and buildings like concrete and shingle, accentuates the presence of stormwater runoff. In most UK cities, this excess runoff is redirected into a <span class="italic">combined sewer system</span>; at which point the water becomes contaminated with sewer water and must be treated as such. Not only does this increase the amount of work needed to be performed by sewage treatment facilities, the increased frequency of <span class="italic">combined sewage overflows</span> (CSOs) being used may contaminate or flood the local environment.</p>

    <p>Instead, <span class="italic">Sustainable (urban) Drainage Systems</span> (SuDS) may be used: a series of management practices and control structures which provide a more sustainable means of draining surface water. Such practices may involve the use of permeable materials for urban development, while others attempt to redirect and redistribute surface water over a wide area. Examples of SuDS features may include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Water Butts:</span> containers which collect and store stormwater runoff, usually from rooftops via rain gutters.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Green Roofs:</span> rooftops on which flora may thrive; which absorb stormwater runoff and provide insulation to the structure.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Soakaways:</span> underground chambers which dispose of surface water, usually by dissipating into the groundwater.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Swales:</span> shallow, vegetated channels; which attenuate and store stormwater runoff. </li>
      <li><span class="bold">Permeable Paving:</span> a range of porous substrates which permit the movement of stormwater through the material.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Detention Basin:</span> excavated regions around bodies of water; which store water temporarily to avoid flooding or erosion.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this context, the term 'wetland' is used to describe a large, shallow expanse of water; in which an abundance of aquatic flora may thrive. In addition to the attenuation and treatment of stormwater runoff, most wetlands also improve biodiversity within the local environment. In turn, the presence of vegetation within a pond may increase <span class="italic">hydraulic retention time</span> (HRT), which can help ensure that the water spends sufficient time in the pond to be adequately treated prior to redistribution.</p>

    <h3>What makes a good pond?</h3>

    <p>Several factors must be considered to evaluate the performance of a pond. Ideally, the entire volume of water should experience some degree of flow; to optimise the rate at which water may be treated. Should a pond exhibit one or more 'dead zones', the water retained within these regions will not be effectively redistributed; nor can additional water be treated within these regions.</p>

    <p>The use of a <span class="italic">sediment forebay</span>, as outlined above, would remove coarse sediments and surface oils upstream; such that sediments may be removed with minimal damage to the pond structure. In shallow ponds or wetlands, the loss of water from evapotranspiration (evaporation and plant transpiration) must also be considered, to ensure that sufficient water is retained to sustain plant growth throughout the year.</p>

    <p>The main treatment zone is the permanent volume which helps prevent resuspension of fine sediments. Ideally large ponds, such as wetlands should be divided into smaller pools. These pools are independent of one another and so water quality and quantity volume storage become independent too. This increases attenuation, creates longer pollutant removal pathways and so improves the removal of pollutants. This also makes an easier maintenance regime and more varied ecology.</p>

    <p>The shape and size of a pond depends heavily on the location; both in terms of available space and the type of environment in which the pond may be situated. In urban environments, this may involve incorporating ponds into community spaces, or otherwise providing an aesthetic which matches the surrounding architecture. In rural environments, this may involve shaping the terrain to blend into the environment; adopting the <span class="italic">look-and-feel</span> of the surroundings.</p>

    <p>Safety should always be a consideration, especially if the pond is going to be in an area with large public access and so it should also contain a safe exceedance route and maintenance access to all areas of the pond. The addition of a flat safety bench around the perimeter of the pond provides suitable distance before open water and so discourages direct access and allows surveillance of the pond and rescue if required. This also provides a maintenance route.</p>
