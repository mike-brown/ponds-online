    <h2>Welcome to Ponds Online!</h2>
    <h3>What is Ponds Online?</h3>

    <p>Ponds Online is an online fluid simulator project for designing stormwater treatment ponds and wetlands. Stormwater is the runoff from rainfall events that builds up on impermeable surfaces found across the urban environment including roofs, pavements and highways. Stormwater ponds allow any sediment gathered to settle out and also support the breakdown by local organisms of any smaller soluble nutrients or chemicals contained. Using these methods, stormwater can be effectively and efficiently treated within the pond system; after which the now-clean water can be redistributed back into the natural water table without harming the environment.</p>

    <h3>Why did we do this?</h3>
    <p>Currently, softwares capable of performing these kinds of simulations are expensive. We wanted to provide the opportunity for people to experiment with computational fluid dynamics, without the costs or complexity associated with most commercial softwares.</p>

    <p>While we have strived to create a versatile simulator, our main focus is stormwater runoff treatment ponds; which play an import role in the treatment and redistribution of water within urban environments.</p>

    <p>This project has been created as part of a SURE Network Project at the <a href="http://shef.ac.uk">University of Sheffield</a>.</p>
